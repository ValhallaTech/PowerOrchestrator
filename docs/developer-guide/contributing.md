# Contributing to PowerOrchestrator

Thank you for your interest in contributing to PowerOrchestrator! This document provides guidelines and standards for contributing to the project.

## Development Workflow

### 1. Fork and Branch

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Create a feature branch from `main`:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

### 2. Development Standards

#### Code Quality

- Follow C# coding conventions and .NET best practices
- Write meaningful commit messages
- Keep commits focused and atomic
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting

#### Testing Requirements

- Write unit tests for new features and bug fixes
- Maintain or improve test coverage
- Run the full test suite before submitting:
  ```bash
  dotnet test --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage"
  ```

#### Documentation

- Update documentation for new features
- Include XML documentation for public APIs
- Update README.md if necessary

### 3. Pull Request Process

1. **Ensure your changes are ready:**
   - All tests pass
   - Code follows project conventions
   - Documentation is updated
   - No merge conflicts with `main`

2. **Create a Pull Request:**
   - Use a descriptive title
   - Provide a detailed description of changes
   - Reference any related issues
   - Add appropriate labels

3. **Code Review:**
   - Address reviewer feedback promptly
   - Keep discussions focused and professional
   - Update your branch as needed

4. **Merge:**
   - Squash commits if requested
   - Ensure CI/CD checks pass
   - Maintainer will merge when ready

## Code Standards

### C# Conventions

- Use PascalCase for public members
- Use camelCase for private members and parameters
- Use meaningful variable and method names
- Prefer explicit types over `var` for clarity
- Follow SOLID principles

### Architecture Guidelines

- Maintain clean architecture separation
- Follow CQRS patterns for application layer
- Use dependency injection appropriately
- Implement proper error handling and logging

### Performance Considerations

- Use async/await for I/O operations
- Implement proper caching strategies
- Consider memory usage and disposal patterns
- Profile performance-critical code paths

## Development Environment

Ensure you have set up your development environment according to the [Setup Guide](setup.md).

### Required Tools

- **.NET 8 SDK**
- **Docker** and Docker Compose
- **IDE**: Visual Studio 2022, VS Code, or JetBrains Rider
- **Git** for version control

### Recommended Extensions

For Visual Studio Code:
- C# Dev Kit
- Docker
- GitLens
